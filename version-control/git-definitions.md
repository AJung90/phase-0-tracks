# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system based around being able to track changes that happen within directories and files. It is useful because it allows us to make reference to when a change was made, which files and directories were affected, what changes happened within those files and directories, a comment describing the changes, and the person who made the commit. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a repository in which you can modify the code without altering or changing the original repository. It is helpful to use in cases where you are working with others as you can all make changes in your respective branches without affecting any other branch or person's work. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a collection of actions in version control that you submit to finalize and record the changes that you made. A good commit message is specific to the change and is concise. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict arises when your changes are very similar to the changes made from another branch before merging. Version control thus has no way of differentiating whose is right or wrong. You can then make deletions and revisions to each branch so that when the merge conflict is resolved, you have one final version.
