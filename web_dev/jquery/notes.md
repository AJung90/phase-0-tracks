My plan to tackle jQuery

* First, I will try and get myself familiar with the syntax. I will look for resources that introduce some concepts and ideas with specific examples.

* Next, I will look through the some jQuery cheatsheets or documentation to make sure I can decipher and read some of the common syntax I've researched and learned.

* Along the way, I will try and implement some of the new things I've learned by creating and testing my own code making sure to take breaks about every half an hour.
