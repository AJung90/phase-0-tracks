My plan to tackle jQuery

* First, I will try and get myself familiar with the syntax. I will look for resources that introduce some concepts and ideas with specific examples.

* Next, I will look through the some jQuery cheatsheets or documentation to make sure I can decipher and read some of the common syntax I've researched and learned.

* Along the way, I will try and implement some of the new things I've learned by creating and testing my own code making sure to take breaks about every half an hour. 

Most effective strategies

* Started out on Codecademy's jQuery course for about 20-30 minutes to familiarize myself with the syntax

* Moved onto jQuery documentation to look at the different types of functions that could be run and tried out some examples
