		<h1 id="1"> A New Level of Dominance in Men's Tennis</h1>
			<p> While the field in men's tennis has certainly become deeper, the level of play demonstrated from The Big Four proves that we are currently witnessing a <strong>Golden Age</strong> in tennis.<p>
			<p> Certainly there have been players just as dominant in past history, but <em>never</em> have we seen four players during the same era create such a stranglehold on the rest of the field.</p>
			<p>The Big Four consists of:</p>	
				<ul>
					<li>Roger Federer</li>
					<li>Rafael Nadal</li>
					<li>Novak Djokovic</li>
					<li>Andy Murray</li>
				</ul>	
			<p>Here are some reasons why this period in men's tennis is so special.</p>
				<ol>			
					<li>These 4 men have a combined 44 Grand Slam titles</li>
					<li>They have a combined earning of hundreds of millions of dollars</li>
					<li>They all have unique and contrasting styles of play</li>
				</ol>
			<p>To see these guys in action, here is a compilation of some of their most extravagent points played throughout the years on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsnbvTmJWU">YouTube.</a>
