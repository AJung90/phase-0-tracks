What are some common HTTP status codes?

* 401 (Unauthorized) occurs when a website visitor tries to access a restricted web page

* 400 (Bad Request) occurs when your web browser accessed something incorrectly

* 403 (Forbidden) occurs when no login opportunity to a website was available to begin with

* 404 (Not Found) occurs when you try to access a resource on a web server that doesn't exist

* 500 (Internal Server Error) occurs when a web server was unable to handle the requests properly

What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

* GET is used to retrieve remote data while POST is used to insert or update remote data. GET should never be used for operations that cause side-effects, meaning that it shouldn't be used when dealing with sensitive information.

What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

* A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser while they are browsing. Cookies serve as a way for websites to remember related information that the user may have previously entered.
