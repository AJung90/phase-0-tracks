What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* The Linux operating system gives the user complete control. It never assumes that the user is incompetent, thus allowing them the freedom for Linux to do whatever the user tells it to.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

* A VPS is a remote machine that exists on the web that acts and functions like your own personal computer. While it is not a physical entity, you can install an operating system and run software on it just as you would with your actual physical computer. The advantages to using VPS are that it's low cost and you don't run the risk of damaging it because you can always just create a new VPS.

Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

* As the root user, you are much more prone to making mistakes or allowing bugs and viruses to run in the programs. Running as root allows for freedom to do virtually anything from deleting files to giving full permission to malicious software and other bad things. Important files could be overwritten, thus to avoid confusion, it is best to run programs as a non-administrator.
