		<p>The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags is to give meaning to specific areas within a document. When working on teams, it helps to keep things consistent when everyone formats their page with tags that have the same meaning. The ones I find most useful are the ones that are most clear to me such as the header, footer, and div tags. The browser displays elements on a page in sequential order, meaning from top to bottom within the document. I learned how to create a Sublime snippet and will plan on using and creating more in the future once I become more familiar with them. The semantic meanings still give me the most difficulty but I'm sure that with more examples, I will be able to grasp the concept a little better.</p>
